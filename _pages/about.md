I am [a PhD student @UW-Madison Physics](https://www.physics.wisc.edu/directory/wu-jianhao/). I am interested in the intersection between astrophysics and fundemental physics, especially using cosmological signals to study fundamental physics problems including early universe, dark matter and dark energy.

I got my MPhil in Physics [@CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) in 2025, under the supervision of [Prof. Tsang Keung Chan](https://tsangkeungchan.com/), fully funded by *CUHK Research Postgraduate Studentship* for this research-based master degree. I worked on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Milky-Way host size dark matter halo substructure simulation for a small scale enhanced primordial power spectrum</span> ([Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 023512 [arxiv:2412.16072]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16072)) and also some follow-up projects. Prior to that, I got a course-based MSc in Physics degree also [@CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) in 2023, with *CUHK MSc in Physics Excellent Performance Award*. It complemented my knowledge gaps as a non-physics student, by excellent teaching and guidance from [Prof. Pak Ming HUI](https://wp.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/teaching_staff/hui-pak-ming) and [Dr. Po Kin LEUNG](https://wp.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/teaching_staff/leung-po-kin).

I got my Computer Science BEng degree [@WHU](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in 2022, where I constrained the physical origin of <span style="font-weight: bold;">North Polar Spur, a bright structure on radio band within Milky-Way, by synchrotron radiation calculation</span> ([Astronomy & Astrophysics 676, L3 [arxiv:2212.04306]](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/08/aa45401-22/aa45401-22.html)). With this paper I won the *Best Presentation Award* of the [CosPA 2024](https://indico.itp.ac.cn/event/198/overview) Symposium. My supervisor and co-author was [Prof. Guobin Mou](https://astrowhu.github.io/guobinmou).
