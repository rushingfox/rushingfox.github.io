I am a Computer Science BEng degree holder@[WHU](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), a Physics MSc degree holder@[CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk).

Starting from 2023 August, I became an MPhil-PhD program (MPhil stream) [student @CUHK](https://newww.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/postgraduate/wu-jianhao), under the supervision of [Prof. Tsang Keung Chan](https://newww.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/teaching_staff/chan-tsang-keung), with a specialization on [Astrophysics & Fundamental Physics](https://newww.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/research-areas/astrophysics-fundamental-physics).

I am interested in the intersection between astrophysics and fundemental physics, and currently working on <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">dark matter halo simulation for modified early universe model</span>.

## Currently looking forward to 2025 Fall PhD position in cosmology.
