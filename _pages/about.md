I am a Computer Science BEng degree holder@[WHU](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), a Physics MSc degree holder@[CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk).

Starting from 2023 August, I am a 1st year MPhil-PhD program (MPhil stream) student @[CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk), with a specialization on [Astrophysics & Fundamental Physics](https://newww.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/research-areas/astrophysics-fundamental-physics). In detail, I am mainly focusing on galaxy formation, especially the formation of the first generation galaxy in the early universe; besides, I am also quite interested in the intersection between astrophysics and fundamental physics, and enthusiastic about applying astrophysics approaches in fundamental physics problems, such as Dark Matter.
